# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
## 1. **JavaScript Operators** 
- JS operators are used to perform various mathematical and logical computations. I was already familiar with some types, including arithmetic, assignment, and logical operators, but I was able to learn new material from ternary operators and expand my knowledge on comparison operators. This is in the format "condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;" I also added on to my prior knowledge of comparison operators with strict equalities and the NOT operator.

## 2. **Input and output functions**
- JS input and output functions are used to interact with accept input from users, as well as display information. These were fairly different from C++ operators in CS 2, so I had a lot to learn, but the new functions we learned in class were much more fluid and diverse, and I was able to work well with them. This includes console.log, document.write, and alert for output as well as prompt and document.getElementById for HTML.

## 3. **Control statements**
- Control statements in JS allow us to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. These include if statements, if- else statements, switch statements, and ternary operators. I already had a working knowledge of if and if-else statements from last year, but I was able to build my knowledge on these through the exercises done in class.

## 4. **Loop control structures**
- Loop control structures in JS are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. These include the for, while, and do-while statements. For and while loops are examples of precondition statements while do-while loops are post-condition statements. These increased in complexity for me this year in the sense that the exercises were more complicated.

## 5. **Declaring and processing functions**
- Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They make your code more organized and easy to maintain. There are native and custom functions, which are called in the same way.I already knew how functions worked based on material from last year,and I was able to apply them to the materials now.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 
## 1. **Array**
- An array is a collection of elements stored in common memory locations. I know that it's used so the programmer won't have to write the same statements for multiple variables, but I have trouble implementing it, especially in conditional and loop statements. I find it complicated especially if there are loops involved.

## 2. **Number systems**
- Number systems are used to represent and manipulate data in various formats. These include decimal, hexadecimal, binary, and octal. This was briefly discussed in Grade 7, but I feel as if I would benefit from a more lengthy discussion because this would help me in some logical aspects of coding.

## 3. **JavaScript HTML**
- HTML is a standard markup language for creating web pages, sometimes used in JavaScript. While I was able to learn some basics on how to use it with JavaScript, I realize that it covers a wide range of topics ad I would benefit more from an in-depth discussion on them. This would also help me in any further endeavors I might have with JavaScript.

## 4. **Functions**
- There are reusable blocks of code used to perform specific tasks, making your code more modular and organized. I feel as if I've had some trouble with this, especially in predefined functions. I've also had some trouble distinguishing between void functions and return functions. 

## 5. **Loop Structures**
- Loop control structures are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. I don't think I've mastered this at the level I should have done by this point, and I get extremely confused with nested loop structures. I wish to learn more about the different types of loops and when they're most appropriate.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. Study lessons in advance
2. Do practice lessons during free time
3. Study in groups with people who understand the topics
5. Perform self-timed speed tests

# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

## Effective
### 1. **Kahoot quizzes**
- Students are actively engaged and are motivated to be alert when this is implemented. The competitive spirit could also ignite a sort of willingness to learn among the class. This will also encourage the students to study in advance.

### 2. **Speed tests**
- Plenty of practice is provided for the people who don't understand the lesson and are afraid to ask in class. The time pressure adds to the drive to finish the code on time and teaches the students the value of being efficient. The teacher is also present to help the students if they wish.

## Non-effective
### 1. **Graded Exercises**
- This could be more effective if students were allowed to research and collaborate with classmates, since the problem is on a level in which the solution wasn't discussed in class. This takes some students who don't understand the lesson a longer time to finish, and it's a quick source of frustration when they aren't aware of the right syntax. Doing these exercises individually and without outside help hinders the students' progress.

### 2. **Diagnostic Test**
- I found this a bit unnecessary since the topics from last year would be discussed along the way anyway and it didn't deserve to take up such a big part of our grades. This was a bit stressful for most students and many were forced to cram reviews. It's good that a foundation was established, but some sort of pre-tests for the new topics would've been better.
